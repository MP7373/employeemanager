> A Vue front end that uses Firestore database with complete CRUD functionality

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

If you actually build this you will be accessing the Firestore I made so if multiple people decided
to do that at the same time there could be a conflict.
